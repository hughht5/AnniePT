						Hello! My name is Angharad Morgan and I am a qualified Personal trainer, spin, gym based boxing and circuit instructor. I'm originally from South Wales but I'm now based in South London.
					</p>
					<p>
						I graduated from Exeter in 2011 with a degree in psychology and finished my MSc in forensic psychology from Kent in 2012. Whilst doing my MSc I decided that psychology was no longer the right path for me so I started a gym instructor distance learning course with Fitness Industry Education.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally I was doing something that I really enjoyed and I was spending most of my time in the gym training for running events and kickboxing.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first running event I took part in was a 10km run for Sports relief in March 2012, I then did the London 2 Brighton 100km Ultra marathon in May 2012 (read my blog for more details on that adventure).
					</p>
					<p>
						I started a blog as soon as I completed the ultra as I thought that people might find it interesting to read about my training and I could give people fitness and nutrition advice.
					</p>
					<p>
						I completed my gym instructor course in September 2012 and went straight on to complete an intensive personal training course with The Training Room. It was there that I also learned about sports nutrition and became a spinning, boxing and circuits instructor.
					</p>
					<p>
						I recently completed the Run to the Beat half marathon in October 2012 and I'm booked in for a few other running events over the next few months.
					</p>
					<p>
						I spend most of my days in the gym focusing on running and strength/endurance training. I also really enjoy attending fitness classes as they keep me motivated. I particularly enjoy spinning, circuits, body pump and body combat and would love to teach the latter at some point!
					</p>
					<p>
						I now have my own spin bike in the living room!
					</p>
					<p>
						I will be setting up some outdoor bootcamps and circuit classes very shortly around the southwark area to begin with so i'll keep you updated about that
					</p>
					<p>
						Please check out my bloggercise1 page, follow me on twitter or facebook to see what I'm up to and let me know what you're doing
					</p>
					<p>
						Also feel free to call or email to have a chat about personal training sessions and the sort of training you would be interested in.
					</p>
					<p>
						Happy training :)
